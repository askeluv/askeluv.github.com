Data Quality is important. However, most companies consider activities such as validating postal addresses and identifying duplicates to be outside of their core business. Luckily, investing in software and building up an internal DQ team isn't the only option to improve Data Quality. In many cases, it makes sense to instead have Data Quality as a Service (DQaaS). 

Below you'll find a short (but growing) list of companies who offer Data Quality as a service. If you know of any companies who should be added to the list, feel free to [tweet me your suggestion](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=webclient&text=%40ASvanevik+%23DQaaS).
