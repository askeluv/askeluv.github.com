I'm Alexander Svanevik, and this is my blog.

First off, you might want to [bookmark](http://feedly.com/#subscription%2Ffeed%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fsvanevik.me%2Fatom.xml) this blog if you're interested in any of the following: languages, data science, productivity, analytics, visualisations, entrepreneurship, startups, consulting, and/or machine learning.

Apart from blogging about the topics above, I'll use this blog to share some of my hobby projects.

Like many others, I spend [most of my time working](http://www.getchronos.com/s?id=b7oi_knQxRj5I3UUa3WjIw) (thanks, [Chronos](https://www.getchronos.com)!). Generally, in my career I've helped organisations use data, analyses and facts to make better decisions. These days I work as a [Data Scientist](http://www.economist.com/node/15557443) for what I think is one of the most exciting companies in Europe: [Schibsted Media Group](http://schibsteddigital.com/). Previously I worked in management consulting, and before that I ran a startup in lovely [Edinburgh](http://bit.ly/edinburgh-image-tour).

Apart from being pathologically obsessed with data, I'm a complete Italophile. I lived in Bologna in 2009 during my studies, which started my love affair with [Il Bel Paese](https://maps.google.no/maps?q=italia) and all things Italian. [Italian 60s and 70s pop music](http://bit.ly/italia-playlist), for instance.

In addition to my [Erasmus](http://www.eng.unibo.it/PortaleEn/Students/International%20Students/OppInterStud/exchange/default) semester at l'Universit√† di Bologna, I have an [MSc Artificial Intelligence](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/informatics/postgraduate/msc/msc-ai) from the University of Edinburgh, and a [BSc Cognitive Science](http://www.uib.no/studyprogramme/BASV-KOGNI) from Universitetet i Bergen.
