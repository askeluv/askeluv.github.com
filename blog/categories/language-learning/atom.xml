    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is my summary of an experiment I started in January 2015: <strong>Learn German in 30 days</strong>.</p>

<p>Before starting, I feel obliged to list a few disclaimers:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;I learned German&rdquo; means I can have basic conversations in German, as well as understand German fairly well (both written and spoken). I have definitely not learned how to speak German perfectly.</li>
<li>I do not claim originality of everything in this text; I&rsquo;ve been heavily inspired by the writings of other language learners such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Learn-Language-Barry-Farber/dp/1567315437">Barry Farber</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Months-Anyone-Language-Anywhere/dp/0062282697/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1425074701&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=benny+language">Benny Lewis</a>.</li>
<li>My native language is Norwegian. This gave me somewhat of an advantage as it is linguistically closely related to German.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you want to learn a language as quickly as possible, you should keep reading. In addition to giving some general tips, and hopefully inspiration, I&rsquo;ve created some resources that I&rsquo;ll share in this text which will help you learn German fast.</p>

<p>I spent about 30-60 minutes daily in my 30-day period, so the time investment wasn&rsquo;t huge.</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s get started.</p>

<h4>Five principles of effective language-learning</h4>

<p>I had an hypothesis that there are <em>five important principles</em> for effectively learning a language. One of the purposes of my experiment was to test if these were any good.
The five principles are:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Set a clear goal</em></li>
<li><em>Speak from day 1</em></li>
<li><em>Focus on frequent words</em></li>
<li><em>Immerse yourself</em></li>
<li><em>Keep track</em></li>
</ol>


<p>Below I&rsquo;ll explain exactly how I used these principles to learn German.</p>

<h4>1. Set a clear goal</h4>

<p>I followed the <a href="https://weekdone.com/resources/objectives-key-results">Objectives and Key Results (OKR)</a> approach for setting a goal. My overall <em>objective</em> was to <strong>learn as much German as possible in 30 days</strong>. More specifically I wanted to accomplish these <em>key results</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Learn the 1000 most frequent German words</strong></li>
<li><strong>Learn 10 German songs by heart</strong></li>
<li><strong>Be able to have basic conversations with my German friends</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>1 and 2 are nice because they&rsquo;re measurable, but the most important key result to me was number 3, which was a bit too vague. In order to make it more tangible, I booked a ticket to Berlin, and decided I should be able to spend the whole weekend with an old (German) friend, speaking only German.</p>

<p>Also, once I had decided that I would actually go through with my plan, I basically announced to the whole world that I was going to learn German in 30 days. The purpose of this was purely psychological, as I then would have to stick to the plan in order to not look like a complete idiot. In fact, throughout my 30-day period, people kept asking me &ldquo;how&rsquo;s the German study going?&rdquo;. To which I could always reply &ldquo;Sehr gut, danke!&rdquo;</p>

<p>(I also secretly decided I would record a video in Berlin speaking in German, which I did at day 29, but I&rsquo;ll spare you the awkwardness of the video I eventually posted on Facebook.)</p>

<h4>2. Speak from day 1</h4>

<p>I believe one of the biggest mistakes you can make when learning a language is to postpone speaking until &ldquo;you&rsquo;re ready&rdquo;. Language learning is like going to the gym: if you want to build muscles, anything other than exercising is just procrastinating.</p>

<p>Specifically what I did to speak from day 1 was to find some friends who either spoke German, or wanted to learn German. I then told them that I would be online for 30 minutes on <a href="http://appear.in">appear.in</a> every day at 8pm and gave them my own custom URL. I told them I would love to practice German with them there. I managed to get 5 people to join in total. None of them were native German speakers, though some were already fluent (which I found to be critically important!), and some were just starting out like me.</p>

<p><img src="/images/appearin_german.jpg" title="Speaking from day 1" ></p>

<p>In order to be able to stay in our target language (&hellip; German), and not revert back to English or Norwegian, I created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TqjM4xdUVeFa32wjTSoswbZenozwz3DJAmzzbWoJZdM/edit?usp=sharing">Cheat Sheet</a> containing essential phrases. This sheet prevented me from getting blocked and generally proved incredibly useful in our online conversations.</p>

<p>Following the &ldquo;language is a muscle&rdquo; analogy, I also repeated out loud anything I heard or read in German when studying on my own. Compared to only passively &ldquo;receiving&rdquo; (listening, reading) German, I think this really makes a difference for strengthening those German synapses in your brain.</p>

<h4>3. Focus on frequent words</h4>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">Zipf&rsquo;s law</a>, you might be surprised to hear that only the 100 most frequent words account for about 50% of all spoken words in German films. Take a moment to reflect on this astonishing fact. This basically means that <strong>every other word you hear in a German film is a word from that top-100 list</strong>. The obvious conclusion? You need to know those words!</p>

<p><img src="/images/zipf.jpg" title="Frequent words are important" ></p>

<p><em>Illustration of Zipf&rsquo;s laws borrowed from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/cowdung112/info-2402-irtchapter4">this</a> presentation.</em></p>

<p>I found a list of the most frequent words in German subtitles <a href="https://invokeit.wordpress.com/frequency-word-lists/">here</a>, and created my own <a href="http://bit.ly/german-top-1000">GoogleDocs spreadsheet</a> with the 1000 most frequent words. These words account for ~75% of all words in German subtitles. My simple task then was to fill out the &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; column for every word before my 30 days had passed. In other words, I had to learn about 30 words per day. I made heavy use of cognates from English and Norwegian in order to learn them, and I exported the words I had learned to <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> about once a week so I could make sure I didn&rsquo;t forget them.</p>

<p>The frequency list is one of the things I did that worked best. It served as a nice anchor that I could centre my learning around.</p>

<p>To test my vocabulary in the real world, I sometimes tried reading German newspapers or books, highlighting words I didn&rsquo;t understand. After reading a page or paragraph, I would count the words I knew vs words I didn&rsquo;t knew, then compute the ratio <em>words known / total words in text</em>. Towards the end of my study period, I would clock in at around 80-85% &ndash; cognates or context helping me push above the 75% I got from the top-1000 list.</p>

<h4>4. Immerse yourself</h4>

<p>Changed my Facebook language to German. Watched lots of <a href="https://www.yabla.com/">Yabla</a> videos.</p>

<p>But the thing that worked best for me was <a href="http://bit.ly/german-10-songs">my Spotify playlist with 10 German songs</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/german_spotify.png" title="Look how many songs I know!" ></p>

<p>Once I had learned the lyrics of these songs, I could play them whenever and be exposed to German anytime I could listen to music. I even recorded myself singing and playing these songs on the guitar. Again I&rsquo;ll spare you the embarrassment.</p>

<p>Picking the lyrics up from just listening to the songs is hard, so I would study the lyrics separately before trying to memorize anything. I used <a href="http://www.lingq.com/">Lingq</a>, which meant I had the lyrics available on my iPhone, and I could easily track which words were new when studying a new song.</p>

<h4>5. Keep track</h4>

<p>My <a href="http://bit.ly/german-top-1000">Top 1000 Words spreadsheet</a> was great for knowing roughly how many words I knew at any given point. Since I had the frequency of each word, I could compute the total &ldquo;mass&rdquo; of German that I knew &ndash; not just the total number of words &ndash; which I found to be quite motivating.</p>

<p>I also kept a simple diary in <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> listing my activities per day. In the end there was only one day when I didn&rsquo;t do anything at all.</p>

<p><img src="/images/german_top_1000.png" title="Look how many words I know!" ></p>

<h4>Other</h4>

<p>I followed a course called <a href="http://www.rocketlanguages.com/german/">RocketLanguages</a>, but I only completed the first 3 modules.</p>

<p>On day 27, I started Duolingo and managed to test in at level 10. Not bad!</p>

<p>I almost didn&rsquo;t do any grammar study, which I think was a good decision since I only had 30 days, and had no ambitions of speaking perfectly. One thing I would have liked to do in order to learn the German cases, though, is a set of 4 sentences of the type &ldquo;The man gave the book to the boy&rdquo; &ndash; one sentence for each gender + plural. Memorizing these four sentences would then probably have been a lot easier than trying to remember a case table.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Having concluded the experiment I would say I reached my goal.</p>

<p>I learned the 1000 most frequent words (and probably some more that I didn&rsquo;t track).
<img src="/images/german_1000words_learned.png" title="Learning 1000 words" ></p>

<p>I learned 10 German songs by heart.
<img src="/images/german_spotify_lingq.png" title="Learning 10 songs" ></p>

<p>And finally, I went to Berlin and had a great weekend with my friend Daniel &ndash; in German. He even taught me how to fly a kite:

<p>If you want to do a similar exercise yourself, here&rsquo;s a table summarizing my approach:</p>

<p><img src="/images/german_principles_in_practice.png" title="Principles in practice" ></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it! Either this gave you some inspiration to start your own 30-day language adventure or you think I&rsquo;m insane. In any case, let me know what you think of my experiment!</p>

    <updated>2014-08-21T10:15:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://askeluv.github.io/blog/2014/08/21/using-music-to-learn-a-foreign-language</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day I picked up one of my favourite albums that I hadn&rsquo;t listened to in years, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/36fWvul2SzklDegMxkLRyC">Sim by Vanessa da Mata</a>. I don&rsquo;t really speak Portuguese, but I was surprised to find that I knew almost all of the lyrics by heart. After considering it a for a while, I concluded that this wasn&rsquo;t very surprising at all. Just think about how many people around the world have learned their first English words from Beatles songs. (&hellip;or from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQt-h753jHI">Mariah Carey songs</a>)</p>

<p>Surely music is a great way to immerse yourself in a new language.</p>

<p>This realisation lead me to an interesting question: <strong>What are the <em>right</em> songs to listen to when you&rsquo;re learning a foreign language?</strong></p>

<p>Putting musical taste aside, I compiled the lyrics of my <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/askeluv/playlist/5AmbWKvEIVujIFeDRyhZVW">Spanish playlist</a> with the simple purpose of sorting the songs from &ldquo;easy&rdquo; to &ldquo;hard&rdquo;. I want to learn one new song every week &ndash; but I want to learn them in a sensible order, based on my level of Spanish.</p>

<p>The first ranking I came up with was fairly simple: calculate the <em>number of (unique) words</em> per song and sort from low to high. The result looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/spanish_songs_num_words.png" title="Number of Words" ></p>

<p>Of course, this isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it tells us something about the <em>effort</em> involved in learning a song. &ldquo;Vuelvo al Sur&rdquo; will most likely take less time to learn than &ldquo;Na en la nevera&rdquo;. So I placed the former at the top of my playlist.</p>

<p>But what about the actual <em>content</em> of the songs? Surely some songs have a more challenging vocabulary than others?</p>

<p>This is hard to accurately quantify, but we can arrive at a proxy for the &ldquo;language level&rdquo; of a song by considering the &ldquo;word rank&rdquo; of the lyrics. The way we do this is by using a frequency list: ordering words in a language from most used to least used. There is no single &ldquo;golden frequency list&rdquo; for a language, since this is context dependent (the words most used in South Park are different from those in the New York Times).</p>

<p>The frequency list I used is based on movie subtitles <a href="http://invokeit.wordpress.com/frequency-word-lists/">available here</a>, which I believe is fairly close to casual, spoken language.</p>

<p>Now, the idea is to look up each word in a song in the frequency list, and get its rank (its &ldquo;word rank&rdquo;). As an example, in my Spanish frequency list, &ldquo;que&rdquo; is the most common word, which means it has word rank = 1. The word &ldquo;nuevo&rdquo; has word rank = 200, meaning there are 199 words that are more frequent than it, and so on.</p>

<p>We compute the word rank for every (unique) word in a song, and then compute the <em>median</em> word rank.</p>

<p>So what does this tell us? Let&rsquo;s say the median word rank is 500 for a given song. This means that 50% of the words in that song will be among the 500 most frequent words. In other words, a large part of the words are &ldquo;easy&rdquo;, frequent words, so we conclude that the song&rsquo;s lyrics are <em>probably</em> not very hard to understand.</p>

<p>Here are the same songs as above, now ranked by median word rank:</p>

<p><img src="/images/spanish_songs_word_rank.png" title="Median Word Rank" ></p>

<p>Again, &ldquo;Vuelvo al Sur&rdquo; shows up first, so I guess I should really learn that song!</p>

<p>Honestly though, I would have expected the lists to be more similar. It turns out, at least for my playlist, there&rsquo;s not a very strong connection between number of words and the median word rank.</p>

<p>Here are the two metrics on one graph:</p>

<p><img src="/images/spanish_songs_scatter.png" title="Number of Words vs Median Word Rank" >
<em>(Notice how the Alejandro Sanz songs are all clustered together!)</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve divided the songs into four quadrants:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hard songs (upper right corner; <em>Q1</em>)</li>
<li>Niche songs with few words (upper left corner; <em>Q2</em>)</li>
<li>Easy songs (lower left corner; <em>Q3</em>)</li>
<li>General songs with many words (lower right corner; <em>Q4</em>)</li>
</ol>


<p>I might be stretching it with my interpretations of <em>Q2</em> and <em>Q4</em>, but in any case there&rsquo;s a trade-off between them; Q4 means more effort required to learn more useful words, while Q2 means less effort required to learn less useful words.</p>

<p>My personal choice would be to learn <em>Q3</em> (<em>easy</em>) songs first, <em>Q1</em> (<em>hard</em>) songs last, and then randomly pick <em>Q2</em> and <em>Q4</em> in between.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think about this approach to learning languages? And have you ever used music to learn a language?</strong></p>
